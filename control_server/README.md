# Control Server

## Introduction

<img src="images/Components_overview_tab.png" style="width: 40%; float: right; border: 2px solid gray; margin: 5px;"></img>

Control Server coordinates communication between **_Constellation_** components and provides a web-based interface for controlling them. It also provides tools for collecting qualitative and quantitative data, tracking maintenance, and logging exhibit issues.


## Terminology

* `gallery`: A physical space in which `exhibit`s take place.
* `exhibit`: The particular configuration of a `gallery`, including the inclusion or exclusion of specific `component`s and the `content` displayed by each `component`.
* `component`: A single display element within a `gallery`. This could be a projector, a screen, an iPad, or a hands-on mechanical interactive.
* `content`: The information being used by a `component`, such as text, images, video, and local configurations. Content specifies the file(s) on the component machine that should be used.
* `id`: A unique identifier for a given `component`. No two `component`s can have the same `id`.
* `type`: A user-defined grouping of `component`s. For example, if you have multiple screens each displaying similar information, you might assign them all the `type` of "INFO_SCREEN". `type`s allow you to send the same command to multiple devices. Every component must have a `type`.

## Setting up Control Server

### Configuring your environment
Many **_Constellation_** `components` will lose functionality if they cannot connect to Control Server. Thus, it is paramount that Control Server runs in a computing environment that is as stable as possible.

#### Environment requirements
* A static IP address
* On Windows, some secondary functionality requires running Control Server with administrator privileges

#### Environment recommendations
* Linux is strongly recommended as the operating system, followed by macOS. Everything should work under Windows, but testing is less thorough and the OS has lower uptime.
* A wired network connection is important to ensure a consistent connection.
* No aspect of **_Constellation_** requires access to the public internet, although Control Server should be on a machine with accurate network time.

### First-time setup
The first time you launch Control Server, the terminal will launch an interactive setup wizard to walk you through basic configuration.

Once the wizard has completed, the server will start. After this point, all configuration will take place via the web console.

### Connecting to the web console
To access the web console from any device on the same subnet, open a browser and enter `http://[static_ip]:[port]`. Note that **_Constellation_** does not support HTTPS.

For example, if your static IP is 10.8.2.100, and your port is the default, 8082, your web address would be `http://10.8.2.100:8082`. You can bookmark this address for future access.

### Configuration

To edit your configuration from the web console, navigate to the Settings tab and click _Edit Settings_. This will open a dialog with a basic configuration guide on the left and an editable text field on the right. When you are done making changes, click _Save_ to exit, then click _Reload Settings_ for them to take effect. Some significant changes, such as editing the IP address or port, will require you to shut down Control Server and launch it again.

Under the hood, the configuration is stored in the file, `galleryConfiguration.ini`. This file, located in the root of your Control Server installation, can also be edited in any text editor.

#### Basic configuration
The following keywords are required:

* `server_ip_address`: This is the public IP address of the Control Server PC. Note that a static IP address needs to be set at the OS or network levelâ€”this value merely records what that address is for distribution to remote clients.
* `server_port`: The port you wish Control Server to be accessible at. This port must not already be in use. Make sure that this port is not being blocked by a firewall.
* `current_exhibit`: The name of the current exhibit configuration file in the form of `<name>.exhibit`. Once the control server is initialized, it will automatically adjust the value of this keyword as you change exhibits using the web console.

The following keywords are optional:

* `gallery_name`: The name of the physical space this control server corresponds to, such as "The Smith Dinosaur Hall."
* `assignable_staff`: A comma-separated list of names to whom issues can be assigned in the `Issues` tab.

#### Controlling projectors
Control Server can manage projectors over IP using the PJLink protocol or serial commands. Since this happens independently of whatever device is actually connected to the projector, projectors are not considered a `component` and do not have `content`. All projectors are assigned the `type` of "PROJECTOR".

##### PJLink
The PJLink protocol returns a defined set of information about the state of the connected projector. Each manufacturer implements the protocol slightly differently, so the available information may vary marginally.

PJLink projectors are defined in the `[PJLINK_PROJECTORS]` section as such:

```
[PJLINK_PROJECTORS]
myprojector = 10.8.0.177
secureProjector = 10.8.1.235, thePassword
```
Each line defines one projector, in which the keyword becomes the `id`. If a projector has a password for access to PJLink, specify it with a comma after the IP address.

##### Serial (RS-232)
Control Server can also manage projectors that implement a serial-over-IP interface. You can also use a wireless serial adapter for projectors that do not implement serial-over-IP. Because every manufacturer implements a different set of functionality, the returned information is much more variable than over PJLink. **If PJLink is available, it is highly recommended.**

Serial projectors are defined in the `[SERIAL_PROJECTORS]` section as such:

```
[SERIAL_PROJECTORS]
mySerialProjector = 10.8.0.175, barco
myOtherProjector = 10.8.1.234, christie
```

In addition to their IP address, you must specify the manufacturer of your device. Because some manufacturers vary their serial commands over generation, there is no guarantee that the control server supports your model, even if your manufacturer is supported. The following makes are at least partially supported:

| Make      | Known compatible models  |
| ----      | ------------------       |
| Barco     | F35                      |
| Christie  | DHD850-GS, Mirage HD8             |
| Optoma    |                          |
| Viewsonic |                          |

#### Wake on LAN

Control Server can send Wake on LAN magic packets to power on machines connected to its network. These devices are specified using MAC addresses, as such:

```
[WAKE_ON_LAN]
My_PC = B0:C7:30:95:93:C0
MY_PC2 = F1-E3-D1-51-B5-A1, 10.8.0.85
```
If the given machine has a static IP address, you can specify it on the same line, after a comma. The control server will ping that address at intervals to check if the machine is powered on. **To send pings on Windows, you must run the control server with administrator privileges.**

#### Tracking non-**_Constellation_** components

In order to view the real-time status of a `component`, it must be either  running a **_Constellation_** software system, or sending pings that conform to the API. However, non-**_Constellation_** `component`s can be added to the system in order to make use of the maintenance tracking system.

To add such a `component`, create a `[STATIC_COMPONENTS]` section in `galleryConfiguration.ini`. The keys will be the `type` and the values will be the `id`s of the components. For example,

```
[STATIC_COMPONENTS]
INTERACTIVE = HAND_SIZE, FOOT_SIZE
DISPLAY = BODY_TYPES
```

will create three static components, HAND_SIZE and FOOT_SIZE of `type` INTERACTIVE, and BODY_TYPES of `type` DISPLAY.

#### Providing component descriptions

You can optionally specify a description for a `component`, which is displayed in the web console on that `component`'s status page. These are specified as such:

```
[COMPONENT_DESCRIPTIONS]
HEADER = The projector for the header at the entrance to the gallery
S_KIOSK = The kiosk near the exit where survey data is collected
```
where the `id` is given to the left of the equals sign and the description to the right.

## Using the web console

The web console is the most convenient way of managing your settings and viewing the state of every `component`. It can be accessed through any modern web browser at the address `http://<control_server_ip>:<control_server_port>`.

### Components tab

The components tab lists every managed `component` and `projector`. Each receives its own tile, which is color-coded by the object's current state. States update automatically, so there is no need to refresh the page.


#### States

| State   | Component | Projector | Wake on LAN |
| -----   | --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| ACTIVE  | Component is currently being interacted with | - | - |
| ONLINE  | Component is responding | Projector is responding, and powered on | - |
| OFFLINE | Component is not responding | Projector is not responding | WoL system is not responding |
| STANDBY | - | Projector is responding, but powered off | - |
| STATIC | Component has been added for maintenance tracking purposes. | - | - |
| SYSTEM ON | The computer is on, but no **_Constellation_** software is responding. | - | The WoL system is responding to pings |
| WAITING | The component was recently ONLINE. There may only be a temporary connectivity issue.  This is common if a display is sleeping. | - | - |
| UNKONWN | - | - | No IP address was supplied for this WoL system, so we cannot ping it to check its status. |

### Component status view

<img src="images/component_status_page.png" style="width: 40%; float: right; border: 2px solid gray; margin: 5px;"></img>

Clicking on a `component` opens its status view. Here, you can see a snapshot of the remote system's performance, manipulate its content (if supported), and add maintenance details.

#### System status

The system status area, located at the top, provides a summary of the performance of the computer running the `component`. These values are only estimatesâ€”if a `component` is behaving inconsistently, use the operating system's tools to diagnose the problem.

Note that CPU usage is not properly reported for `component`s running Windows.

#### Content pane

##### Content management

The content management area allows you to manipulate the displayed `content` for components that support it. Note that this panel only shows `content` managed by the system helper, including all `content` uploaded through the web console.

`Content` highlighted in blue is in the current display queue, which loops indefinitely. To add or remove a piece of `content`, click it to toggle it. These changes are not saved until the "Save changes" button is pressed.

`Content` can also be deleted from the system using the item's dropdown menu. Note that deleting content takes effect immediately and cannot be undone.

##### Content upload

New `content` can be uploaded using the bottom part of the Content pane. Click the "Choose files" button and select one or more files that you wish to upload.

**Note that uploaded filenames cannot contain an equals sign (=).** If you upload a file with the same filename as a piece of existing `content`, the old file will be overwritten. The name of the file on your device will be carried over to the client.

#### Maintenance pane

The maintenance pane allow you to track the maintenance status of the component. Four states are available:

* On floor, working
* On floor, not working
* Off floor, working
* Off floor, not working

In addition, you may add notes using the provided text box. Changes to the notes or status are not saved until the _Save changes_ button has been pressed.

Changes to the maintenance status of a `component` are logged by the control server. These logs are in plain-text format in the `maintenance-logs` directory. Each line of a log is a JSON object containing the state at the time of submission.

### Projector status page

Clicking on a `projector` that is `ONLINE` or `STANDBY` will bring up its status page. Here, you can see an array of information reported by the projector using the PJLink protocol.

### Schedule tab

The schedule tab allows you to set recurring or one-off events within the `gallery`. The following options are available:

* Send power on, power off, and restart commands
* Refresh `components`
* Set the `exhibit`
* Set `content` for a single `component`

Note that sending power off and power on commands may affect different `component`s differently. For `projectors`, this will sleep or wake them. For `Wake on LAN` devices with shutdown permitted, the machine will be shutdown.

### Issues tab

<img src="images/issue_creation_modal.jpg" style="width: 50%; float: left; border: 2px solid gray; margin: 5px;"></img>

The issues tab organizes information about the current state of the `gallery` and its `components`. It provides an easy interface for non-technical users to alert maintenance staff about a problem, as well as to see a summary of the overall `gallery` health.

#### Issues

Issues are not tied to a specific `exhibit`, but are a property of the overall space. They can be connected to a **_Constellation_** `component` or simply a note about the state of the facility. When creating an issue, you can give it a priority, assign it to a specific person, and connect it with a `component`. You can also upload a photo for reference. If you're using the web console on a mobile device, you can even take the picture directly from within the interface.

Known issues can be filtered by priority and who they are assigned to.

#### Maintenance overview

The maintenance overview summarizes the current state of the `component`s. From the component status view on the components tab, maintenance staff can enter notes about various pieces, as well as categorize them into one of four groups:

- On the floor and working
- On the floor and not working
- Off the floor and working
- Off the floor and not working

The various `component`s are grouped into these categories on the maintenance overview. The status bar underneath each `id` shows the fraction of time the `component` has been working or not working.

### Settings tab

#### Changing the exhibit

Use the "Set current exhibit" dropdown box to change the `exhibit` being displayed. **This change takes immediate effect and may result in an unsightly transition in public view.**

#### Creating and deleting exhibits

You can create and delete `exhibit`s from the settings tab. When creating an `exhibit`, you can either create an empty `exhibit` (no content for any `component`), or you can clone the existing `exhibit`.

#### Reloading galleryConfiguration.ini

If you make a manual change to `galleryConfiguration.ini`, pressing the "Reload Config" button will cause the control server to reload it and parse the new configuration as if it were starting up. This means you do not have to stop and restart the server process to make an update.

### Hiding tabs

The tabs can be hidden from view by modifying the URL. For example, to hide the schedule tab, change the URL to read `http://[Your IP]:[Your Port]/webpage.html?hideSchedule`. To hide both the help and settings tabs, use `http://[Your IP]:[Your Port]/webpage.html?hideHelp&hideSettings`.

Hiding tabs can be useful when creating a status console for certain staff, without showing them the deeper configuration options. **Note that these options can be re-enabled simply by modifying the URL, so this is not a secure method of limiting access.**

## Using the flexible tracker

<img src="images/tracker_example.jpg" style="width: 50%; float: right; border: 2px solid gray; margin: 5px;"></img>

The `flexible tracker` enables the collection of a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative data using the control server. Collected data is stored as a list of JSON objects, one object per line, in a plain text document on the server.

### Collection types
The tracker can collect a variety of data types. Each type provides a widget that makes inputting the data easy and reliable.

| Type | Description | Required keywords | Optional keywords |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| `counter` | Count by whole numbers, like a traditional "clicker" counter. | - | `label`: string |
| `dropdown` | Select one or more options from a list | `options`: comma-separated list of strings. | `multiple`: true/false (default: false) `label`: string |
| `number` | Record a single number, including decimals | - | `label`: string |
| `slider` | Record a single number, bounded in a user-defined range. The value is selected using a slider. | - | `min`: number (default: 1) <br> `max`: number (default: 100) <br> `step`: number (default: 1) <br> `start`: Inital slider position (default: `(min + max)/2`) <br> `label`: string |
| `text` | A textbox for inputting any text | - | `lines`: The height of the box in lines (default: 5) <br> `label`: string |
| `timer` | Records the number of seconds. Can be started and stopped by the user. "Exclusive" timers pause all other timers when started. | - | `exclusive`: true/false (default: false) <br> `label`: string |

### Creating a template

<img src="images/tracker_template_edit.jpg" style="width: 50%; float: right; border: 2px solid gray; margin: 5px;"></img>

A `template` defines the collection types available for a given session. It allows you to customize Flexible Tracker for your specific needs. The recommended way to create a template is through the web console.

#### Using the web console

To create a `template` via the web console, navigate to the settings view. In the Flexible Tracker section, select the `template` you want to edit, first creating it if necessary. Then, click the edit button to pop up the template editor. The left column contains the possible collection type widgets. Click on one to add it to the current layout, and customize its parameters using the fields in the right column.

With the left and right arrows, you can reorder how the widgets will appear. Because Flexible Tracker is a responsive web page, the exact arrangement of the widgets will depend on your device's screen size and shape.

#### Creating a template manually

Each template is an INI file located within Control Server in the directory `flexible-tracker/templates/<your template>.ini`. Within the `template`, each section header is the name of the item. Under each header, add keywords (one per line) to specify the desired collection. Keywords and values should be separated by an equals sign (`=`). The keyword `type` must appear in each section and **each section must have a unique name**. For example, the following `example.ini` will produce the displayed Flexible Tracker session.

```
[Visitor type]
type = dropdown
options = Adult, Child, Family, Field trip

[Interaction time]
type = timer
exclusive = true
label = Time spent touching the interactive.

[Observing time]
type = timer
exclusive = true
label = Time spent observing what the interaction is doing.

[Questions asked]
type = counter
label = The number of questions they ask.

[Observations]
type = text
```

Adding or modifying a `template` does not require restarting the Control Server; however, an instance of Flexible Tracker will need to be refreshed in order to reflect any changes.

### Recording data

To use Flexible Tracker for data collection, select yoru desired `template` from the web console settings view and click the "Launch" button. All available `template`s will be available from the dropdown list. Once you are ready to send a session (one set of observations), press the Record button. This will transmit the data to Control Server for storage. Please note that a network connection to the server is required to send data; if such a connection is not available, a popup will appear and the Record button will be disabled.

Data are stored in the Control Server under `flexible-tracker/data/<template name>.txt`. Each row is a single JSON object representing one session.

### Downloading and managing data

Once you have collected some data, you can easily download it as a comma-separated values (CSV) file that cane be read by Microsoft Excel or another data analysis app. To do so, go to the settings view from the web console and select the appropriate `template`. Then, click the "Download data" button and a CSV download will be initiated in your browser.

By clicking the "Clear data" button, you can erase the existing data. This action cannot be undone.

## Integrating with **_Constellation_**
Control Server communicates with `component`s using HTTP requests. Connecting a custom `component` is as simple as sending and receiving the appropriate requests.

### Required actions

#### Pings

Control Server does not search for new `component`s. Rather, each `component` must send a request to the known static IP of the server. This is called a _ping_. A ping should be sent every five seconds as a POST request containing a JSON object with the following properties.


| Field   | Type | Value | Required | Meaning |
| -----   | --------- |--------- | --------- | --------- |
| class | String | "exhibitComponent" | Yes | - |
| id | String | A unique, user-defined value| Yes | - |
| type | String | A user-defined value | Yes | - |
| AnyDeskID | String | The ID corresponding to an AnyDesk entry running on the host PC | No | - |
| allowed_actions | array of strings | Any subset of ["restart", "shutdown", "sleep"] | No | Sending these values indicates that the `component` is able and willing to respond to their corresponding commands. Don't send an action if you have not implemented a method of responding to it. |
| currentInteraction | String | "true" or "false" | No | Send "true" if the `component` has been interacted with in the last 30 seconds. Send "false" if it has not. For a `component` with an attractor, you can also send "true" if the attractor is not displayed. |
| error | JSON object | The keys of the stringified object should be the names of the errors, with the values being a short error message | No | This field allows you to report errors or warnings, which will be displayed on the web console. |
| helperAddress | String | An HTTP address, including the port, of a server capable of responding to requests | No | This is required for the `component` to respond to certain commands, such as shutting down or restarting. |


#### Commands

Your system should implement as many of these commands as makes sense for your use case. These actions enable **_Constellation_** to remotely control your `component` and integrate it into schedules.

Commands are passed to the `component` as responses to a ping. The returned JSON object will have a `commands` field containing a list of string commands. If you implement any of `power_on`, `power_off`, `restart`, `shutdown`, or `sleepDisplays`, make sure you have indicated this in the `allowed_actions` field of every ping.

| Command                      | Intended action                                                  | Notes |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------| ----- |
| `disableAutoplay`            | Stop any automatic cycling of the `content`                      | - |
| `enableAutoplay`             | Resume any automatic cycling of the `content`                    | - |
| `pauseVideo`                 | Pause any currently playing video                                | -|
| `playVideo`                  | Start or resume play of a video                                  | - |
| `power_off`                  | Alias of `shutdown`                                              | - |
| `power_on`                   | Alias of `wakeDisplay`                                           | If you want to wake the PC from a shutdown, make sure it is capable of wake on LAN and add the MAC address to the `[WAKE_ON_LAN]` section of  `currentExhibitConfiguration` |
| `refresh_page`               | Refresh the browser window or reset the current screen           | - |
| `reloadDefaults`             | Reset the `component` to its initial condition                   | - |
| `restart`                    | Initiate a restart of the PC                                     | - |
| `seekVideo_[back/forward]_X` | Seek video X% in the given directoni | For example, `seekVideo_back_10` will rewind by amount equal to 10% of the video's length. |
| `shutdown`                   | Shutdown the PC                                                  | This command should only be implemented if the PC can be woken by wake on LAN. If `shutdown` is not implemented, but `sleep` is, then make `shutdown` an alias of `sleep` so that the display can be put to sleep on a `shutdown` command. |
| `sleepDisplay`               | Put the PC's display to sleep                                    | - |
| `toggleAutoplay`             | If `content` is automatically cycling, stop that. If not, start it | - |
| `wakeDisplay`                | Wake the PC's display                                            | - |

#### Example

To send a ping, you create a JSON object as shown below and send it to the IP address and port of the Control Server.

```json
{
  "class": "exhibitComponent",
  "id": "YOUR_ID",
  "type": "YOUR_TYPE",
  "helperAddress": "10.8.0.12:8082",
  "allowed_actions": ["sleep", "restart"],
  "AnyDeskID": "123456678"
 }
```

Control Server will send a response to this request with the following form:

```json
{
  "commands": ["wakeDisplay"]
}
```

### Optional actions

Your `component` may also send commands to Control Server to manipulate the state of the server or other `component`s. These commands are sent as HTTP POST requests. There are two main categories of these commands. _Webpage commands_ send and receive the data that are reflected in the Control Server web console. _Tracker commands_ send and receive analytics data.

When Control Server receives a command, it will respond with an acknowledgement in the form of a JSON object. Check the `success` field to determine if the command ran successfully. It will be either `true` or `false`. If `success == false`, there will be a `reason` field indicating why the operation failed.

#### Webpage actions

##### `fetchProjectorUpdate`

Retrieve the current state of the specified projector.

| Required fields | Optional fields | Response fields | Notes |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ----- |
| `class`: `webpage` <p> `action`: `fetchProjectorUpdate` <p> `id`: (string) The projector to query | - | `reason`: string <p> `state`: A JSON object of projector properties <p> `status`: [`"DELETE"` \| `null`] <p>`success`: [`true` \| `false`] | If `status  == "DELETE"`, the projector no longer exists and should be removed. |

##### `reloadConfiguration`

Instruct Control Server to reload its state from `galleryConfiguration.ini`.

| Required fields | Optional fields | Response fields | Notes |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ----- |
| `action`: `reloadConfiguration` <p> `class`: `webpage` | - | `success`: [`true` \| `false`] | - |

##### `queueCommand`

Send a command to a specific `component`. The _Commands_ section above defines commands that should be widely available in **_Constellation_**. In addition, you can specify custom commands as a single string that your custom `component` can understand. Control Server will route them without needing to understand them.

| Required fields | Optional fields | Response fields | Notes |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ----- |
| `action`: `queueCommand` <p> `class`: `webpage` <p> `command`: (string) The command to queue <p> `id`: (string) The component the command should be sent to| - | `reason`: String <p> `success`: [`true` \| `false`] | - |

##### `queueProjectorCommand`

Send a command to a specific projector.

| Required fields | Optional fields | Response fields | Notes |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ----- |
| `action`: `queueCommand` <p> `class`: `webpage` <p> `command`: (string) The command to queue <p> `id`: (string) The projector the command should be sent to| - | `reason`: String <p> `success`: [`true` \| `false`] | - |

For projectors that support PJLink, the following commands are supported:
* `error_status`
* `get_model`
* `lamp_status`
* `power_off`
* `power_on`
* `power_state`

For projectors connected via serial commands over Ethernet, command support is manufacturer dependent. Even for supported manufacturers, every model may not be supported.
