# Constellation Apps
A collection of visitor-facing apps to help you create rich digital experiences, connected by **_Constellation_**.

## Philosophy
Constellation Apps is focused around flexibility. To that end, it uses the web browser to display its visitor-facing content. That means any device that can display a website can turn into a digital exhibit component.

However, web browsers are limited in their ability to interact with the underlying computer. Your browser can't, for instance, reboot your PCâ€”probably a good thing! Because of this, Apps uses a secondary program (the _helper_) running outside the browser to store your content and interact with the PC itself.

As mentioned, the interface can be anything with a web browser. But the helper must be a PC running Windows, macOS, or Linux. Thus, the easiest way to use Constellation Apps is on a PC. If you want to, for instance, collect word cloud input from an iPad, you'll need both a PC and the iPad.

## First-time setup
Constellation Apps must be hosted by a PC running Windows, macOS, or Linux, even if the user-facing interface is a mobile device such as an iPad.

### Installation
For maximum flexibility, Constellation Apps does not use an installer. Simply download the version appropriate for your operating system [here](https://cosmicchatter.org/constellation/constellation.html) and place the file in the location you would like to run Apps from. Then, launch the file.

A command-line setup window will launch, asking you a few basic questions. Once you use the keyboard to answer, Apps will launch and open a graphical interface in your default web browser.
