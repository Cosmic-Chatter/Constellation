# InfoStation
InfoStation provides a touchscreen interface for creating digital labels. It supports text, images, and videos across multiple languages.

## Limitations
* Optimized for use with a vertical 16:9 display powered by a Linux or Windows PC.

## Configuration

### Choosing hardware
InfoStation works best in **_Constellation's_** default, locally-installed mode. This means that it is best to run InfoStation on a Linux or Windows PC connected to the display that you want to use. 

Connecting to a remote instance (such as using an iPad) is supported, but, requires a stable network connection.

## Markdown basics

Text is formatted using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Markdown is a powerful way of formatting text using simple symbols, but let's go over just a few of the basics.

Here is some simple text formatted with Markdown:

# The Space Race
The Space Race was a competition between the United States and Soviet Union for scientific and technological preeminence in space that extended from the early 1950s until 1975.

Milestones during the Space Race included the launch of **Sputnik 1** by the U.S.S.R in 1957, the landing of _Eagle_ on the surface of the Moon as part of **Apollo 11**, and the joint U.S.-U.S.S.R **Apollo-Soyuz Test Project** in 1975.

## First Steps
...
```
Markdown uses the `#` symbol to indicate headers. The headers get smaller as symbols are added, so `#` is a bigger header than `##` and so forth. Text is italicized by placing underscores around it (`_italics_`) and bolded using asterisks (`**bold**`). Finally, you can embed and place images following this pattern:

```md
![placement](file_path "Title")
```

`placement` should be one of `left`, `right`, or `full` and the title must be in quotes. Images should be uploaded as content and the `file_path` should begin with `content/` as shown above.

InfoStation will break up the text into sections defined by top-level headers (`#`).
