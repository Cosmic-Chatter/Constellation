# InfoStation
InfoStation provides a touchscreen interface for creating digital labels. It supports text, images, and videos across multiple languages.

## Limitations
* Optimized for use with a vertical 16:9 display powered by a Linux or Windows PC.

## Configuration

### Choosing hardware
InfoStation works best in **_Constellation's_** default, locally-installed mode. This means that it is best to run InfoStation on a Linux or Windows PC connected to the display that you want to use. 

Connecting to a remote instance (such as using an iPad) is supported, but, requires a stable network connection.
