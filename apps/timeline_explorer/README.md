# Timeline Explorer
Timeline Explorer builds touchscreen timelines from a spreadsheet.

## Configuration

### Choosing hardware
Timeline Explorer can operate from either a local machine (i.e., a Windows or Linux PC with a touchscreen display) or a remote client (such as an iPad). If using a remote client, it is still required to install Constellation Apps on a PC.

### Spreadsheet format
Timeline Explorer requires spreadsheets to be in the common _comma-separated value_ (`CSV`) format. If you are using Microsoft Excel, you can easily create this file by choosing _File_ > _Save As..._ and selecting _CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (.csv)_ from the File Format options.
